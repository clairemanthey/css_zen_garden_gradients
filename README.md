## Introduction

CSS Zen Garden is place on the ewb to show the power of CSS. It shows can CSS can be used to create aesthetically pleasing websites and show how to implement different techniques pushing the boundaries of design 

## Motivation

I was motivated to create a design to challenge my own CSS skills and creativity to create something new. Since this this project was created several years ago CSS has changed, I took this challenge as way to practice my desing skills for as many browsers and versions of browsers as possible. Designing fall backs for elements that are not widely supported.

## Design

I used this as a challenge to get more familiar with gradients and how they can be used in a website. Without interferring or creating barriers between the user and the content. I began with mobile first, creating the design for the smallest screen size and the adjusting for larger screen sizes.

## HTML Changes

While one constrainst is not to change the HTML, one my goals was to make this site accessible. Given it's age practices around accessible and designing for accessibility have expanded to make websites accessible to all users. The only changes I made to the HMTL was to make the site more accessible for users. I removed the header and footer elements from the div they were nested in to create landmarkers for users the use screen readers.

## What I Learned
I found in this challenge I learned how to use more CSS selectors. Part of the challenge is not alter the HTML I could not just add a class to a tag. I used a variety of selector combinations including child, sibling, as well as using CSS to create pseudo elements.
